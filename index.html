            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company 
            I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to 
            make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
            I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled 
            shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of 
            my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, 
            working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure 
            from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to 
            enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
            The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never 
            had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. 
            It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, 
            I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It 
            certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
            100% recommend!"
